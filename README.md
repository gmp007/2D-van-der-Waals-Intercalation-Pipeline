# Custom Design of 2D-based van der Waals Materials

## Introduction
This repository contains tools and workflows for the automated design of 2D-based van der Waals (vdW) materials. Our focus is on creating novel materials by intercalating 2D vdW materials with conjugated small organic molecules.

### Material-Design-Pipeline
The Material Design Pipeline is a comprehensive tool that automates the creation process of 2D-based van der Waals materials. It integrates computational methods and algorithms to predict and analyze the properties of newly designed materials.

### Active-Learning-Workflow
Following the design phase, the Active-Learning Workflow (ALW) employs an active learning approach. This method efficiently scans through a vast chemical space to identify the most stable materials, optimizing the search and discovery process using intercalation energy as the search parameter.

## Features
- **Automated Design**: Streamline the creation of 2D vdW materials with advanced algorithms.
- **Active Learning**: Utilize machine learning techniques to predict material stability.
- **Intuitive Interface**: User-friendly tools designed for both beginners and experts in material science.
